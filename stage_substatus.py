"""A stage's status is no better than the worst of its own sub-results.

`alpha-engine-config-I10198`, enforcing `sf-pipeline-policy.md` §2.3b, clause
`SFP-2.3b-stage-status-is-the-worst-substatus` (`nous-ergon-ops-PR1119`).

Root cause this exists
----------------------
Measured on the 2026-08-15 scheduled weekly run (execution
`54acfc69-…_f1036888-…`, read live 2026-09-08)::

    EvalRollingMean -> eval_rolling_mean_result.Payload
        status:        "OK"
        agent_quality: {"status": "ERROR",
                        "error": "'str' object has no attribute 'isoformat'"}

Identical on 2026-08-22. Those are exactly the two weeks with no
`AlphaEngine/Eval/agent_quality_score` datapoint at all — and the control
bands went on reporting `IN_CONTROL` against a fortnight-old point, because a
band evaluated over an empty window has no breach to find.

**Nothing was broken.** Every §2.3 degradation mechanism — the SF `Catch`, the
`Mark*Degraded` Pass states, `$.research_degraded_local`, the completion
marker's `status: DEGRADED` — keys off the STAGE's status, and the stage said
`OK`. A nested failure was never a rule being broken; it was a rule that never
applied.

Why this is not a list of known sub-keys
----------------------------------------
A hand-written set of sub-result names to check is the shape that let this
survive: `agent_quality` would have been added to it only after the week it
cost. The scan is structural — any nested mapping carrying its own ``status``
string, at any depth — so a sub-result added tomorrow is covered without an
edit here.

Why the vocabularies are CLOSED
-------------------------------
A status in neither vocabulary is reported as UNCLASSIFIED, never defaulted to
a pass. A checker that reads an unrecognised status as healthy goes quiet the
first time a producer invents a word for failure (`principles.md` §2.7).

Relationship to the fleet copy
------------------------------
`nous-ergon-ops/scripts/sf_substatus_honesty.py` is the CONFORMANCE probe for
the same clause — it reads a finished execution's history and names violators
after the fact. This module is the PRODUCER side: it stops the stage from
emitting the dishonest status in the first place. The two vocabularies below
are deliberately identical to that script's, and `nousergon-lib` is the lift
target that would remove the duplication (`policy-shared-code`); filed rather
than done here because that repo was outside this change's blast radius.
