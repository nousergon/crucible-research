"""Every spot launcher in this repo resolves through the ops-owned krepis guard.

**The defect** (`alpha-engine-config-I6931`, second half tracked as
`alpha-engine-config-I7343`). Until 2026-08-14 every spot launcher in the fleet
defaulted its interpreter to a co-tenant's checkout::

    LIB_PYTHON="${LIB_PYTHON:-/home/ec2-user/alpha-engine-dashboard/.venv/bin/python}"

— NINE such lines across FIVE repos. So the version of ``krepis.ec2_spot``,
``krepis.ssm_dispatcher`` and ``krepis.spot_bootstrap`` that launches every spot
workload of all three Step Functions pipelines was governed by
``crucible-dashboard/requirements.txt``, which no merge in this repo can see, and
an absent or too-old venv produced a ``ModuleNotFoundError`` at launch rather
than a statement of what was wrong.

**The fix** is one ops-owned wrapper, ``/opt/nousergon/bin/lib-python``
(`nous-ergon-ops-PR676`), which execs the box's DECLARED krepis venv and aborts
with ``EX_CONFIG`` (78) naming the version it found when that venv is absent or
below the launcher floor. It never falls back. Each launcher's diff is the one
line naming it — writing the guard per launcher would be nine copies of one
contract across five repos, which is the `alpha-engine-config-I6922` defect one
layer down.

**What this test holds.** That the launchers in THIS repo keep resolving through
the guard, and that no launcher re-acquires a private fallback. Every assertion
is derived from the scripts on disk — no line numbers, because these files move.
