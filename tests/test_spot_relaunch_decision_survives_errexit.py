"""``_spot_failure_reason`` must survive the CLI's ordinary "hold" answer.

THE DEFECT CLASS

``krepis.ec2_spot relaunch-decision`` signals its verdict by EXIT CODE — ``0``
= relaunch, ``NO_RELAUNCH_EXIT_CODE`` (75) = hold. Hold is the designed answer
for every failure that is *not* an AWS spot reclaim, i.e. nearly all of them.
Every launcher in the fleet called it as::

    _decide_out="$(... relaunch-decision ... )"
    _decide_rc=$?

under ``set -e``. An assignment fed by a command substitution is a simple
command whose exit status IS the substitution's, so the ordinary answer is an
errexit trigger, and ``_decide_rc=$?`` — the line that exists to READ that
status — is unreachable.

WHAT THIS REPO'S COPIES ACTUALLY DID, MEASURED

Not the same thing the other three repos did, and the difference is worth
pinning rather than assuming. In ``crucible-predictor``, ``crucible-backtester``
and ``crucible-dashboard`` the call sits directly in the body of the EXIT trap,
so errexit destroyed the shell mid-trap, ``terminate-instances`` was never
reached, and the spot instance leaked — silently, because ``set -e`` does not
re-enter a trap it is already running. Confirmed on
``ne-weekly-freshness-pipeline/watch-rerun-2026-08-10-9`` (2026-08-11) via
CloudTrail: no ``TerminateInstances`` for ``i-092854cbb6e62b753``.

Here the call sits inside ``_spot_failure_reason``, whose sole caller writes::

    reason="$(_spot_failure_reason "$rc")" || reason=""

Bash suppresses errexit for the entire dynamic extent of a command on the left
of ``||``, *including inside functions it invokes*. Measured 2026-08-12 with a
harness reproducing both shapes: this one completes, returns 1, and cleanup
runs. **No instance was leaked from this repo.** ``nousergon-data`` carries the same shape and the same measurement.

WHY IT IS STILL FIXED, AND WHY THIS TEST EXISTS

The correctness of this function was a property of one punctuation mark
at one call site, not of the functions themselves. Deleting that ``||``, or
adding a second caller without it, converts this into the live defect the other
three repos had — and nothing would announce it, because the only evidence is
an absent CloudTrail event.

So the test deliberately calls the function in an errexit-ACTIVE context, which
is precisely the context the ``||`` was hiding. With the guard, the function
reaches its diagnostic line and returns 1 (correctly: hold means do not relaunch).
Without it, the function aborts at the substitution and the diagnostic never
appears — which is exactly what the assertion looks for.
