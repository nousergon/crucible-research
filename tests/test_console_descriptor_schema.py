"""Schema-contract test for `console.descriptor.yaml` (alpha-engine-config-I9497).

`console.descriptor.yaml` at the repo root is this component's onboarding onto
the fleet console (console-policy.md §2.6). This test is the producer-side
half of that contract: it loads the descriptor and validates it against a
vendored copy of nousergon-console's own schema — mirroring
`crucible-evaluator/tests/test_console_descriptor_schema.py`, the first
consumer of this pattern. This repo has no runtime dependency on
nousergon-console, so the schema is a fixture, not an import.

`tests/fixtures/component_descriptor.schema.json` and
`tests/fixtures/console_known_drivers.json` are copies of
`nousergon-console/console/schemas/component_descriptor.schema.json` and
`console/drivers/__init__.py::KNOWN_DRIVERS`, verified byte-identical against
nousergon-console main on 2026-08-31. Copies, not symlinks, because this is a
public AGPL repo and nousergon-console's working tree is not guaranteed
present at test time; re-sync by hand if the upstream schema changes.
